I am a first year PhD student studying mathematics at UCLA, where I am advised by [Professor Inwon Kim](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~ikim/). I am interested in Analysis and Applied Mathematics. I am currently working on the Analysis of Partial Differential Equations related to Tumor Growth and Populatio Dynamics.


As an undergraduate, I worked with [Professor Marcus Roper](https://www.marcusroper.org) on inertial migration of particles where I was selected as an [Undergraduate Research Fellow](http://sciences.ugresearch.ucla.edu/programs-and-scholarships/urfp/).
