I am a first year PhD student studying mathematics at UCLA. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and went to UCLA for my undergraduate as an Applied Math major. I am studying Partial Differential Equations under the supervision of [Professor Inwon Kim](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~ikim/)

As an undergraduate, I worked with [Professor Marcus Roper](https://www.marcusroper.org) on interial migration of particles where I was selected as an [Undergraduate Research Fellow](http://sciences.ugresearch.ucla.edu/programs-and-scholarships/urfp/).
