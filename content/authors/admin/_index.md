Hi! I am a second year PhD student studying mathematics at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where I am advised by [Professor Inwon Kim](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~ikim/). I am interested in Analysis and Applied Mathematics. I am primarily working on the Analysis of Partial Differential Equations. 

As an undergraduate, I studied Applied Mathematics at UCLA and worked with [Professor Marcus Roper](https://www.marcusroper.org) on inertial migration of particles.

I am also interested in mentoring undergraduates. I am currently a committee member and mentor for the Directed Reading Program (DRP) at UCLA. I am also a graduate student represenative for the Undergraduate Studies Committee.
